# Tech Conference Event Page

This project is a fully responsive tech conference event page built using only HTML and CSS. It presents all key information about the GeeksforGeeks TechCon 2025 in a clean and structured layout that works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The page includes an introduction section, event details, a complete schedule table, speaker profiles, and a contact form. Each section is clearly separated to improve readability and user experience. The responsive design is achieved using CSS media queries.
